"Creating lots of Shapes in a loop means for every step ``fuse`` and "
"``clean`` will be called. In an example like the below, both functions get "
"slower and slower the more objects are already fused. Overall it takes on an"
" M1 Mac 4.76 sec."

"One way to avoid it is to use lazy evaluation for the algebra operations. "
"Just collect all objects and then call ``fuse`` (``+``) once with all "
"objects and ``clean`` once. Overall it takes 0.19 sec."
