"Topology, in the context of 3D modeling and computational geometry, is the "
"branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of "
"geometric objects that are preserved under continuous deformations. In the "
"context of CAD and modeling software like build123d, topology refers to the "
"hierarchical structure of geometric elements (vertices, edges, faces, etc.) "
"and their relationships in a 3D model. This structure defines how the "
"components of a model are connected, enabling operations like Boolean "
"operations, transformations, and analysis of complex shapes. Topology "
"provides a formal framework for understanding and manipulating geometric "
"data in a consistent and reliable manner."
