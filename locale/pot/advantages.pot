msgid "As mentioned previously, the most significant advantage is that build123d is more pythonic. Specifically:"

msgid "Standard Python Context Manager"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:7
msgid "The creation of standard instance variables, looping and other normal python operations is enabled by the replacement of method chaining (fluent programming) with a standard python context manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:33
msgid "The use of the standard `with` block allows standard python instructions to be inserted anyway in the code flow.  One can insert a CQ-editor `debug` or standard `print` statement anywhere in the code without impacting functionality. Simple python `for` loops can be used to repetitively create objects instead of forcing users into using more complex `lambda` and `iter` operations."

msgid "Instantiated Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:42
msgid "Each object and operation is now a class instantiation that interacts with the active context implicitly for the user. These instantiations can be assigned to an instance variable as with standard python programming for direct use."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:54
msgid "Operators"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:56
msgid "New operators have been created to extract information from objects created previously in the code. The `@` operator extracts the position along an Edge or Wire while the `%` operator extracts the tangent along an Edge or Wire. The position parameter are float values between 0.0 and 1.0 which represent the beginning and end of the line. In the following example, a spline is created from the end of l5 (`l5 @ 1`) to the beginning of l6 (`l6 @ 0`) with tangents equal to the tangents of l5 and l6 at their end and beginning respectively. Being able to extract information from existing features allows the user to \"snap\" new features to these points without knowing their numeric values."

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:75
msgid "Last Operation Objects"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:76
msgid "All of the `vertices()`, `edges()`, `faces()`, and `solids()` methods of the builders can either return all of the objects requested or just the objects changed during the last operation. This allows the user to easily access features for further refinement, as shown in the following code where the final line selects the edges that were added by the last operation and fillets them. Such a selection would be quite difficult otherwise."

msgid "Extensions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:90
msgid "Extending build123d is relatively simple in that custom objects or operations can be created as new classes without the need to monkey patch any of the core functionality. These new classes will be seen in IDEs which is not possible with monkey patching the core CadQuery classes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:96
msgid "Enums"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:98
msgid "All `Literal` strings have been replaced with `Enum` which allows IDEs to prompt users for valid options without having to refer to documentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:102
msgid "Selectors replaced by Lists"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/advantages.rst:103
msgid "String based selectors have been replaced with standard python filters and sorting which opens up the full functionality of python lists. To aid the user, common operations have been optimized as shown here along with a fully custom selection:"
