msgid "Here instance variables ``l1`` and ``l2`` are assigned to the two BuildLine objects and the ``ThreePointArc`` references the beginning of the straight line with ``l1 @ 0`` and the end with ``l1 @ 1``.

msgid "As mentioned previously, one of the two primary reasons to create BuildLine objects is to use them in BuildSketch.  When a BuildLine context manager exits and is within the scope of a BuildSketch context manager it will transfer the generated line to BuildSketch. The BuildSketch :meth:`~operations_sketch.make_face` or :meth:`~operations_sketch.make_hull`  operations are then used to transform the line (specifically a list of Edges) into a Face - the native BuildSketch objects."

This rule applies to points and to the use of tuples to modify locations calculated with the ``@`` and ``%`` operators such as ``l1 @ 1 + (1, 1)``. For example, if the workplane is ``Plane.YZ`` the local value of ``(1, 2)`` would be converted to ``(0, 1, 2)`` in global coordinates.  Three tuples are converted as well - ``(1, 2, 3)`` on ``Plane.YZ`` would be ``(3, 1, 2)`` in global coordinates. Providing values in local coordinates allows the designer to automate such conversions."

It's unlikely that users will need to use ``Vector`` values but the option is there."
