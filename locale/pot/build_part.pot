msgid "The following is a simple BuildPart example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_part.rst:22
msgid "The ``with`` statement creates the ``BuildPart`` context manager with the identifier ``ex2`` (this code is the second of the introductory examples). The objects and operations that are within the scope (i.e. indented) of this context will contribute towards the object being created by the context manager.  For ``BuildPart``, this object is ``part`` and it's referenced as ``ex2.part``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_part.rst:29
msgid "The first object in this example is a ``Box`` object which is used to create a polyhedron with rectangular faces centered on the default ``Plane.XY``. The second object is a ``Cylinder`` that is subtracted from the box as directed by the ``mode=Mode.SUBTRACT`` parameter thus creating a hole."

msgid "The BuildPart context keeps track of pending objects such that they can be used implicitly - there are a couple things to consider when deciding how to proceed:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_part.rst:44
msgid "For sketches, the planes that they were constructed on is maintained in internal data structures such that operations like :func:`~operations_part.extrude` will have a good reference for the extrude direction.  One can pass a Face to extrude but it will then be forced to use the normal direction at the center of the Face as the extrude direction which unfortunately can be reversed in some circumstances."

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_part.rst:61
msgid ":func:`~operations_generic.sweep` requires a 2D cross section - ``handle_cross_section`` - and a path - ``handle_path`` - which are both passed implicitly."

msgid "Parts created with build123d have no inherent units associated with them. However, when exporting parts to external formats like ``STL`` or ``STEP`` the units are assumed to be millimeters (mm).  To be more explicit with units one can use the technique shown in the above tea cup example where linear dimensions are followed by ``* MM`` which multiplies the dimension by the ``MM`` scaling factor - in this case ``1``."

msgid "The BuildPart class is another subclass of Builder for building parts (objects with the property of volume) from sketches or 3D objects. It has an _obj property that returns the current part being built, and several pending lists for storing faces, edges, and planes that will be integrated into the final part later. The class overrides the _add_to_pending method of Builder."
