msgid "BuildSketch is a python context manager that is used to create planar two dimensional objects - objects with the property of area but not volume - that are typically used as profiles for BuildPart operations like :func:`~operations_part.extrude` or :func:`~operations_part.revolve`."

msgid "The ``with`` statement creates the ``BuildSketch`` context manager with the identifier ``circle_with_hole``. The objects and operations that are within the scope (i.e. indented) of this context will contribute towards the object being created by the context manager.  For ``BuildSketch``, this object is ``sketch`` and it's referenced as ``circle_with_hole.sketch``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_sketch.rst:29
msgid "The first object in this example is a ``Circle`` object which is used to create a filled circular shape on the default XY plane. The second object is a ``Rectangle`` that is subtracted from the circle as directed by the ``mode=Mode.SUBTRACT`` parameter. A key aspect of sketch objects is that they are all filled shapes and not just a shape perimeter which enables combining subsequent shapes with different modes (the valid values of Mode are ``ADD``, ``SUBTRACT``, ``INTERSECT``, ``REPLACE``, and ``PRIVATE``)."

msgid "Often when designing parts one needs to build on top of other features.  To facilitate doing this ``BuildSketch`` allows one to create sketches on any Plane while allowing the designer to work in a local X, Y coordinate system. It might be helpful to think of what is happening with this metaphor:"

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_sketch.rst:70
msgid "The highlighted part of the code shows how a face is extracted from the design, a workplane is constructed from this face and finally this workplane is passed to ``BuildSketch`` as the target for the complete sketch.  Notice how the ``display`` sketch uses local coordinates for its features thus avoiding having the user to determine how to move and rotate the sketch to get it where it should go."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/build_sketch.rst:77
msgid "Note that ``BuildSketch`` accepts a sequence planes, faces and locations for workplanes so creation of an explicit workplane is often not required. Being able to work on multiple workplanes at once allows for features to be created on multiple side of an object - say both the top and bottom - which is convenient for symmetric parts."

For example, to display the local version of the ``display`` sketch from above, one would use:"

As Faces don't provide an x-direction it's possible that the new Face may not be oriented as expected.

It has an _obj property that returns the current sketch being built. The sketch property consists of the sketch(es) applied to the input workplanes while the sketch_local attribute is the sketch constructed on Plane.XY. The class overrides the solids method of Builder since they don't apply to lines."
