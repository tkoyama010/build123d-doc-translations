Here is the Axis is setup such that a position of 0 aligns with the screw being fully set in the hole and positive numbers indicate the distance the head of the screw is above the leaf surface. One could have reversed the direction of the Axis such that negative position values would correspond to a screw now fully in the hole - whatever makes sense to the situation. The angular range of this joint is set to (0°, 360°) as there is no limit to the angular rotation of the screw (one could choose to model thread pitch and calculate position from angle or vice-versa)."
