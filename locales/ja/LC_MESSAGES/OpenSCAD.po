"Welcome to build123d! If you're familiar with OpenSCAD, you'll notice key "
"differences in how models are constructed. This guide is designed to help "
"you adapt your design approach and understand the fundamental differences in"
" modeling philosophies. While OpenSCAD relies heavily on Constructive Solid "
"Geometry (CSG) to combine primitive 3D shapes like cubes and spheres, "
"build123d encourages a more flexible and efficient workflow based on "
"building lower-dimensional objects."

"Transitioning to build123d allows you to harness a modern and efficient "

"OpenSCAD's modeling paradigm heavily relies on Constructive Solid Geometry "
"(CSG) to build models by combining and subtracting 3D solids. While "

"CSG is a powerful method for creating 3D models, but it has limitations when"
" dealing with complex designs. build123d’s approach offers several "
"advantages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:34
msgid ""
"**Simplified Complexity Management**: Working with 2D profiles and faces "
"instead of directly manipulating 3D solids simplifies your workflow. In "
"large models, the number of operations on solids can grow exponentially, "
"making it difficult to manage and debug. Building with 2D profiles helps "
"keep designs modular and organized."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:40
msgid ""
"**Improved Robustness**: Operations on 2D profiles are inherently less "
"computationally intensive and less error-prone than equivalent operations on"
" 3D solids. This robustness ensures smoother workflows and reduces the "
"likelihood of failing operations in complex models."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:45
msgid ""
"**Enhanced Efficiency**: Constructing models from 2D profiles using "
"operations like **extruding**, **lofting**, **sweeping**, or **revolving** "
"is computationally faster. These methods also provide greater design "
"flexibility, enabling you to create intricate forms with ease."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:50
msgid ""
"**Better Precision and Control**: Starting with 2D profiles allows for more "

"In build123d, the design process typically begins with defining the outline "

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:148
msgid ""
"OpenSCAD and build123d offer distinct paradigms for creating 3D models, as "
"demonstrated by the angle iron example. OpenSCAD relies on Constructive "
"Solid Geometry (CSG) operations, combining and subtracting 3D shapes like "
"cubes and cylinders. Fillets are approximated by manually adding high-"
"resolution cylinders, making adjustments cumbersome and less precise. This "
"static approach can handle simple models but becomes challenging for complex"
" or iterative designs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:154
msgid ""
"In contrast, build123d emphasizes a profile-driven workflow. It starts with "
"a 2D sketch, defining the geometry’s outline, which is then extruded or "
"otherwise transformed into a 3D model. Features like fillets are applied "
"dynamically by querying topological elements, such as edges, using intuitive"
" filtering methods. This approach ensures precision and flexibility, making "
"changes straightforward without the need for manual repositioning or "
"realignment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../build123d/docs/OpenSCAD.rst:160
msgid ""
"The build123d methodology is computationally efficient, leveraging "
"mathematical precision for features like fillets. By separating the design "
"into manageable steps—sketching, extruding, and refining—it aligns with "
"traditional CAD practices and enhances readability, modularity, and "
"maintainability. Unlike OpenSCAD, build123d’s dynamic querying of "
"topological features allows for easy updates and adjustments, making it "
"better suited for modern, complex, and iterative design workflows."

"In summary, build123d’s sketch-based paradigm and topological querying "
"capabilities provide superior precision, flexibility, and efficiency "
"compared to OpenSCAD’s static, CSG-centric approach, making it a better "
"choice for robust and adaptable CAD modeling."

"**Leverage Topological References**: Use build123d's powerful selector "
