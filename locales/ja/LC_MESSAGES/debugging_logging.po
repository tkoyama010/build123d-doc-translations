"Debugging problems with your build123d design involves the same techniques "
"one would use to debug any Python source code; however, there are some "

"Many Python IDEs have step by step debugging systems that can be used to "
"walk through your code monitoring its operation with full visibility of all "

"This shows that a break-point has been encountered and the code operation "
"has been stopped.  From here all of the Python variables are visible and the"
" system is waiting on input from the user on how to proceed.  One can enter "
"the code that assigns ``top_face`` by pressing the down arrow button on the "
"top right. Following code execution like this is a very powerful debug "
"technique."
