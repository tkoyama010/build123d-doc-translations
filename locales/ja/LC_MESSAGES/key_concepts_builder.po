"There are two primary APIs provided by build123d: builder and algebra. The "
"builder API may be easier for new users as it provides some assistance and "
"shortcuts; however, if you know what a Quaternion is you might prefer the "
"algebra API which allows CAD objects to be created in the style of "
"mathematical equations. Both API can be mixed in the same model with the "
"exception that the algebra API can't be used from within a builder context. "
"As with music, there is no \"best\" genre or API, use the one you prefer or "

"The **Builder** paradigm in build123d provides a powerful and intuitive way "
"to construct complex geometric models. At its core, the Builder works like "
"adding a column of numbers on a piece of paper: a running \"total\" is "
"maintained internally as each new object is added or modified. This approach"
" simplifies the process of constructing models by breaking it into smaller, "
"incremental steps."

"As build123d is a 3D CAD package one must be able to position objects "
