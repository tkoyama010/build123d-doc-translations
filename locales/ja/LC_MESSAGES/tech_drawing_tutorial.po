"This example demonstrates how to generate a standard technical drawing of a "
"3D part using `build123d`. It creates orthographic and isometric views of a "
"Nema 23 stepper motor and exports the result as an SVG file suitable for "
"printing or inspection."

"The script uses the `project_to_viewport` method to project the 3D part "

"(camera origin and up direction) and places the result onto a virtual "
"drawing sheet."
