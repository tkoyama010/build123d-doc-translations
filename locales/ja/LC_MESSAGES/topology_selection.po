"Sorting by axis is often the most straightforward way to optimize "
"selections. In this part we want to revolve the face at the end around an "
"inside edge of the completed extrusion. First, the face to extrude can be "
"found by sorting along x-axis and the revolution edge can be found sorting "
"along y-axis."

"A ``sort_by_distance`` can be used to sort objects by their distance from "
"another object. Here we are sorting the boxes by distance from the origin, "
"using an empty ``Vertex`` (at the origin) as the reference shape to find "

"The example can be extended by first sorting the boxes by volume using the "
