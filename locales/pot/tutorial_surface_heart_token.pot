msgid "This hands‑on tutorial introduces the fundamentals of surface modeling by building a heart‑shaped token from a small set of non‑planar faces. We’ll create non‑planar surfaces, mirror them, add side faces, and assemble a closed shell into a solid."

msgid "As described in the `topology_` section, a BREP model consists of vertices, edges, faces, and other elements that define the boundary of an object. When creating objects with non-planar faces, it is often more convenient to explicitly create the boundary faces of the object. To illustrate this process, we will create the following game token:"

msgid "In this tutorial, we've explored surface modeling techniques to create a non-planar heart-shaped object using build123d. By utilizing methods from the :class:`~topology.Face` class, such as :meth:`~topology.Face.make_surface`, we constructed the perimeter and central point of the surface. We then assembled the complete boundary of the object by creating the top, bottom, and sides, and combined them into a :class:`~topology.Shell` and eventually a :class:`~topology.Solid`. Finally, we added a frame around the heart using the :func:`~operations_generic.offset` function to maintain a constant distance from the heart."
